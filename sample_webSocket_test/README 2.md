 ## üßê web-socket  sample chat project  
On my journey to learn about websocket, I have created a simple chat, I was inpired by the demo at https://www.websocket.org/echo.html

I used javaScript  without any third party library 


1. user should connect before sending message.
2. Display all the message on the log screen
3. display message to notify when the user is connected or disconnected
